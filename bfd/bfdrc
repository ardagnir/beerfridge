# Note: this format will be changed soon. Bfd doesn't currently renice programs, and after thinking about it, I'll probably never add that functionality. Instead bfd will probably use cgroup shares.

# My example usecase is for awesomewm where every tag is COLD/NORMAL/HOT excpet a few that are COLD/COOL/HOT (hidden tag/visible tag/currently focused client)
# COLD is for processes in other tags and is 0 unless we need it running in background
# ICE_COLD is for manual freezing and should always be 0
# COOL/NORMAL are when the process is visible but not selected
# HOT is when a process is being used. Let's make all gui programs mean in this case so they feel more smooth.
