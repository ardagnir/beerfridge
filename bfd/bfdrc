# My example usecase is for awesomewm where every tag is COLD/NORMAL/HOT excpet a few that are COLD/COOL/HOT (hidden tag/visible tag/currently focused client)

# COLD is for processes in other tags and is 0 unless we need it running in background
# ICE_COLD is for manual freezing and should always be 0

# COOL/NORMAL are when the process is visible but not selected
# HOT is when a process is being used.

#range is shares-cap
#m means mute

#Process    ICE_COLD      COLD        COOL        NORMAL      HOT
