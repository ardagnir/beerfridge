START_VARIABLES
#This is multiplied times denominator and all the numerators and so doesn't affect how much processes are slowed down. But it affects the actual numbers stored in the cgroup files.
multiplier: 100

#Denominator represents 100%. Values set to denominator are allowed 100% of the cpu.
denominator: 1000

#Guibias determines how processes affected by beerfridge are weighted against other processes.
# 8 is balanced (at denominator, bf is given the same numer of shares as other programs)
# 2 gives bf programs a quarter the cpu shares as 8
# 16 gives them twice as many cpu shares as 8
guibias: 10

# My example usecase is for awesomewm where every tag is COLD/NORMAL/HOT excpet a few that are COLD/COOL/HOT (hidden tag/visible tag/currently focused client)

# COLD is for processes in other tags and is 0 unless we need it running in background
# ICE_COLD is for manual freezing and should always be 0

# COOL/NORMAL are when the process is visible but not selected
# HOT is when a process is being used.

#range is shares-cap
#m means mute

#Process    ICE_COLD      COLD        COOL        NORMAL      HOT
